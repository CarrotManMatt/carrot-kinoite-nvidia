CarrotManMatt's Personal Custom Linux Image

## ISO

This repo includes a simple Github Action to build and release an ISO of this image. 

To run the action, simply edit the `boot_menu.yml` by changing all the references to startingpoint to your repository. This should trigger the action automatically.

The Action uses [isogenerator](https://github.com/ublue-os/isogenerator) and works in a similar manner to the official Universal Blue ISO. If you have any issues, you should first check [the documentation page on installation](https://universal-blue.org/installation/). The ISO is a netinstaller and should always pull the latest version of your image.

Note that this release-iso action is not a replacement for a full-blown release automation like [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).
